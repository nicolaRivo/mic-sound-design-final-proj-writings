**Masters project notes**

- Pattern break

- Stereo difference

- Beat map the song and then align a transient of white noise with each beat so that the spectrogram will create a white line each beat to visually see beat shifting?

- Produce a track that contains my favourite and most relevant elements of the tracks I have analysed.

- Each track has a specific element of maximum interest and find it represented in the spectrogram
