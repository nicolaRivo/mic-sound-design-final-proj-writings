# FINAL PROJECT DIARY

## 24 · 06 · 24
Today I emailed my program leader with the draft of my final project concept, which at this time is the following:

> The idea I want to pursue for my final project is a structural and timbral analysis of a selection of musical tracks through the aid of graphic scores and spectrograms. I am thinking about titling it "Flat Sounds: Building Maps to Navigate Structure, Pattern, and Timbre."
 >
>During your Soundtracks for Screen module, you had us produce a visual score for a snippet of a soundtrack, and I found that practice to be a very powerful and creative way to learn valuable lessons from a piece of audio. These lessons would otherwise be quite difficult to grasp if experienced only through aural appreciation. This is the graphical score I produced for that exam. I would like to use a similar approach to investigate the elements of a sonic composition that tend to be more elusive to the ear of an aural-trained musician like myself.

>  To do this, I aim to choose 10-15 tracks from various genres that have relevant structures and rely on pattern creation/dissolution and interesting timbral/sound design elements. For each track, I will use the spectrogram as the basis of my map and will trace and draw on top of those with an attempt to create a consistent color/shape code to point out relevant characteristics. I will then trace analogies and differences between the chosen pieces and draw conclusions on how similarities and anomalies contribute to the success of each piece.
> 
> In my analysis, I will try to avoid as much as possible any traditional tonal music theory considerations (tonal harmony, diatonic/chromatic scale melodies), as I find these features to be quite obvious to my ear. Instead, I will dig deep into the analysis of timbral composition (frequency spectrum analysis), micro and macro structural elements (repeated patterns, breaking of patterns, dynamic movement), and spatial elements (use of fore, mid, and background, use of the stereo field).
> 
> These are some of the tracks I have in mind at this stage:
> 
> -   "Oo Licky" - Matthew Herbert
> -   “DARE” - Gorillaz
> -   “Workingonit” - J Dilla
> -   “An Eagle In Your Mind” - Boards of Canada
> -   “I swear, I Really Wanted To Make a "Rap" Album But This Is Literally The Way The Wind Blew Me This Time” - Andre 3000
> -   “One of These Days” - Pink Floyd
> 
> The idea is to produce this project as a potential book. If time allows, I might investigate typographic elements in order to make it  a potential physical product.

Started finding publications and academic articles that would guide my initial idea. Reinstalled Zotero an linked it with Safari. this is the list of books and publications I have selected at this stage of the progress:


	1. A graphic score for any musicians or non-musicians.pdf
	2. A guide to the graphic score project.pdf
	3. A model for rhythm and timbre similarity in electronic dance music.pdf
	4. Audio Culture - Readings in modern music.pdf
	5. Conceptualizing music.pdf
	6. Graphic notation - the simple sketch and beyond.pdf
	7. Introduction To Graphic Scores.pdf
	8. Music Structure Analysis from Acoustic Signals.pdf
	9. Music Structure Analysis.pdf
	10. Natural Highs - Timbre and Chills in Electronic Dance Music.pdf
	11. Popular Music Studies Today.pdf
	12. Review - Unlocking the Groove - Rhythm, Meter, and Musical Design in Electronic Dance Music.pdf
	13. Signal Processing for Music Analysis.pdf
	14. Sonic Visualiser - Visualisation, Analysis, and Annotation of Music Audio Recordings..pdf
	15. State of the Art Report - Audio-Based Music Structure Analysis.pdf
	16. The Cultural Significance of Timbre Analysis.pdf
	17. Timbre and Affect in Electronic Dance Music Discourse.pdf
	18. Timbre and the “Zone of Entanglement” in Electronic Dance Music Re-Thinking Musico-Social Ontologies with the Mycelial Turn.pdf
	19. Tuning-in to the Beat - Aesthetic Appreciation of Musical Rhythms Correlates with a Premotor Activity Boost.pdf
	20. Undercurrents - The Hidden Wiring of Modern Music.pdf 
	21. Unlocking the Groove - Rhythm, Meter, and Musical Design in Electronic Dance Music.pdf

I will read one of this per day and write a paragraph on what his brings towards my final project.

reading through the first article – *A model for rhythm and timbre similarity in electronic dance music*, which focuses on the timbric and rhythmic patterns in EDM.
>Timbre and rhythm in EDM are often more important than melody and harmony (Reynolds, 2012)

That's a good point for continuing investigating in genres that develop from an EDM background

> A structural change in EDM is defined by the characteristic evolution of timbre and rhythm as opposed to a verse–chorus relation common in pop or folk music. Because an EDM track may exhibit several structural changes, similarity must be defined on the level of individual music segments.

It's interesting to see how these changes in EDM graphically develop as opposed to more rock/pop pieces.

I didn't actually write much in this diary for the past month but I have been going forward with my analysis of music that spans different genres.

I have decided to avoid relying on  
I have managed to put together a few scripts that produce some interesting graphs starting from my songs of choice.
The graphs that seem more interesting for my purposes are the following:

 - Mel Spectrogram 
 - Chroma 
 - Self similarity Matrix

 **Mel Spectrogram** 
This can be a very useful tool in understanding how a piece of music changes over time in detail as it holds information on the amount of energy of a section (the brighter the louder), the ratio tonal/rhythmic content as its very easy to visually distinguish between tonal information (horizontal lines with overlapping harmonics) and rhythmic information (vertical lines that span the whole harmonic range). By studying this kind of graph applied to different pieces
